The work has been carried out as part of the course 'Fundamentals of Hypersonic Flows' of the masters curriculum. The motivation behind the work is to understand the principles of hypersonic flows such as thermal and chemical non-equilibrium in the context of scramjets. Therefore, this work based on CFD has has been carried out for 3 cases of Mach numbers for a cold and hot gas, where hot gas with a high temperature is supposed to mimick the combustion. Initially, the equilibrium cases were analysed to understand the effects of Mach numbers and shock reflections inside the chamber. Then the case of chemical non-equilibrium was performed to visualise and understand how the finite rate chemical reactions occuring. Finally, a case of chemical and thermal non-equilibrium has been performed to see how the roto-translational and vibrational temperatures vary across the chamber.
